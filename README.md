# Tournament emulation excercise

Repository contains set of unit tests in preconfigured project necessary to get dependencies and run tests.
But code this tests are written for does not exist.
You have to implement tournaiment logic and necessary classes in order to make tests pass green.
Tests code must not be changed, except imports.
Please assume that you are writing business production ready code.
The goal of this exercise is to check problem solving skills, so final goal is not just green tests but clean problem field solution.

Expected time requirements are about 3h.
